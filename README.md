# resourceExploitation
ODE models containing the within-vector resource acquisition dynamics and the epidemiological framework

This study consists of two simulation and two plotting scripts:

1. resourceCompetitionSweep.R computed the setady states of eggs and parasite udner different competition strengths $alpha$, and saves the results to text files. 
2. epidemiologicalFramework.R loads the results generated by the previous scripts and calculates the basic reproduction number R0

The scripts plotWithinVectorCOmpetition.R and plotFitness.R visualize the results as heatmaps using the "viridis" package to ensure color-blind friendly colours
